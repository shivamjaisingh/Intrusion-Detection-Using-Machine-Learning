# Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project focuses on developing machine learning classifiers designed to detect and classify various cyber threats. These classifiers are trained to differentiate between benign and malicious behaviours by analyzing network traffic data, aiming to effectively identify potential security threats.

## Data Exploration
The SIMARGL2021 dataset, which includes samples of both benign and malicious network traffic, is used for analysis. Initial steps in exploring this dataset involve:

### Data Understanding: Analyzing the dataset to identify key characteristics such as the number of features, types of cyber attacks represented, and any data redundancy.
### Data Visualization: Visualizing different aspects of the dataset to better understand the distribution and frequency of various labels.

## Model Development
Various machine learning algorithms are applied to develop the classifiers, including:

- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Gaussian Naive Bayes

Each model is carefully trained and validated on the dataset to enhance its reliability and performance.

## Evaluation
After training, each classifier's performance is evaluated, with a focus on its accuracy in detecting and classifying network threats.
